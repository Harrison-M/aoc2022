# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

My code for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). If you're interested, I encourage you to try the problems yourself before looking at anything here.

## Structure

This is a cargo workspace with a binary crate for each day. You can read about workspaces and how to use them in [Part 14.3 of *The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html)

## License

See COPYING.WTFPL. I'm offering the code under the WTFPL because it has limited practical use, and I don't want people learning Rust to be afraid of cribbing things from the exercises here.
